# Portfolio App 

Welcome to m**Portfolio App** a modern React-based web application designed to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences in a clean and interactive way.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

- Launches the app in **development mode**
- Opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
- Auto-reloads when you edit files
- Displays errors and lint issues in the console

### `npm test`

- Starts the test runner in watch mode
- Useful for running unit and integration tests

### `npm run build`

- Builds a **production-ready** version of the app
- Optimizes performance, bundles React efficiently
- Output is saved in the `/build` folder

### `npm run eject` (Optional)

> ⚠️ Use with caution!

This command gives you full control over the build setup, exposing all configuration files. It's not reversible!
